<b>Take Back Your Privacy From Windows 11</b>

This powershell script modifies dozens of settings to to comply with DISA STIG for Windows 11 V1R2.  This script also removes or disables features of Windows 11 which are completely unnecessary such as tracking, meta-data uploads, hand writing, speech submissions, etc.

1)  Download the ZIP file from above
2)  Create a System Restore Point in case something goes wrong
3)  Open POWERSHELL ISE...Right click the icon and select RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR  <b>(DO NOT USE POWERSHELL ISE (X86))</b>
4)  Open the Windows11.ps1 in Powershell ISE
5)  Run <b>set-executionpolicy bypass</b>
6)  Click the Green Arrow in the toolbar to run the script
7)  Reboot after the script finishes

If you find this utility useful please consider donating to me.
This script took over 2 weeks of working on it daily of researching, troubleshooting errors, troubleshooting VM problems, etc...and I'll continue to research other setting which need adjusting.
